[Browserdiet.com](http://browserdiet.com) is yet another bullet list (27 items
at the time of writing) of [the frontend performance best
practices](/post/livre-high-performances-web-sites). I like it because it is
done in a fun way with some nice images (like the one above) and the content is
well written while being short enough to not discourage the reader. It probably
misses some categories because [use for instead of
each](http://browserdiet.com/#use-for-instead-of-each) should not be at the same
level as [combine multiple JS files into
one](http://browserdiet.com/#combine-js) for instance, but still most of the
content is interesting.

If you care about the user experience of your visitors/users, you should really
try to apply as much as possible those practices, it is not that difficult and
the results are usually very visible.

Another cool thing, the code and the content are [available on
GitHub](https://github.com/zenorocha/browser-diet), so if you are not fine with
the content or the design, it's easy to fix the issue with a simple pull
request; and yes [the fully yellow background was
ugly](https://github.com/zenorocha/browser-diet/issues/46) ;-)
