[CSS Flexible Box Layout module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/) is one of
the new CSS features that becomes usable right now thanks to the faster
evolution of web browsers. The best quick description of flexbox is probably the
very first sentence of the specifications:

> The specification describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface
> design.

And yeah after using it [at work on
PlatformUI](https://github.com/ezsystems/PlatformUIBundle) or [on the new
version of this blog](/post/powered-by-metalsmith/), I can definitively say:
**flexbox is awesome**. At least, it helps solving some very basic user
interface problems. Have you ever dreamed of vertically centering something in
CSS? [With flexbox, you
can](https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/vertical-centering/) :-)

Caniuse.com reports [flexbox to be *somehow* supported by all major
browsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox) and even from Internet Explorer from
version 10!  So if you don't have/want to support Internet Explorer 9, it's
definitively a good choice.

That said, from a practical point of view, the *somehow* in the previous
paragraph is an important fact. It actually means that Internet Explorer 10
implements an old version of the specification with a bit different syntax with
the `-ms-` prefix (often refered as the 2012 syntax) and Internet
Explorer 11 has some bugs but to be fair, [others browsers also have bugs on
flexbox](https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs). And as usual, you also need
to add the `-webkit-` prefix as well (yes iOS Safari, I'm looking at you).
If we take [the very first example of the
specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/#example-0401c357), it should
be adapted to the following code to be working in the current browsers:

```css
#deals {
  display: -webkit-box;
  display: -webkit-flex;
  display: -ms-flexbox;
  display: flex; /* from the original example */
  -webkit-flex-flow: row wrap;
      -ms-flex-flow: row wrap;
          flex-flow: row wrap; /* from the original example */
}
.sale-item {
  display: -webkit-box;
  display: -webkit-flex;
  display: -ms-flexbox;
  display: flex; /* from the original example */
  -webkit-flex-flow: column;
      -ms-flex-flow: column;
          flex-flow: column; /* from the original example */
}
.sale-item > img {
  -webkit-box-ordinal-group: 0;
   -webkit-order: -1;
  -ms-flex-order: -1;
           order: -1; /* from the original example */
   -webkit-align-self: center;
  -ms-flex-item-align: center;
           align-self: center; /* from the original example */
}
.sale-item > button {
  margin-top: auto; /* from the original example */
}
```

As you can see, this results in a much longer stylesheet with more *workarounds*
than initial code! Of course with a good memory and a bit of bravery, this can be
done by hand but this is typically the kind of task that can and should be
automated.
To be honest, the previous code snippet was generated by
[Myth](http://www.myth.io/) and you can find several tools to do the same
transformation like [Pleeease](http://pleeease.io) or
[cssnext](http://cssnext.io/). So pick one and just use it. I know it's yet
another tool in your toolbox but it will be useful not only for
flexbox related code but also for various others non fully supported CSS
features.

So, where to start with flexbox? So far, the best flexbox guide I've seen is [A
Complete Guide to
Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) available in
[CSS-Tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/) which also recently published 
[Designing A Product Page Layout with
Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/designing-a-product-page-layout-with-flexbox/)
to see how flexbox can be practically used. Also, [Solved by
Flexbox](https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/) is a great online
resource and I'm sure there are tons of others.
