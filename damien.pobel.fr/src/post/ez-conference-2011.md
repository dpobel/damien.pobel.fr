The eZ Conference 2011 is over and as [I said on Twitter, it was
GREAT](http://twitter.com/#!/dpobel/status/82033631715012608)! I've seen many
people telling me that this edition was at the same level than [the 2007
one](/post/ez-conference-2007) which is the reference for me. I'm very happy to
have seen some (french) friends from the eZ ecosystem and to have met new people
and even some stars from the PHP world like Rasmus Lerdorf and Derick Rethans
;-) As a new comer in eZ Systems, I also met some of my new
colleagues, I'm pleased to be able to put a face on some names!

As always, the eZ Award evening was fun and even if the following morning was a
bit tough ;-) Congratulation to all winners, especially to
Jérôme and Gilles, you deserve
this price.

On the talks side, there were some really nice presentations. My top 3 is :

* [PHP in 2011](http://talks.php.net/show/ezkey2011) by Rasmus Lerdorf (hey that's THE creator of PHP ;-)
* [Profiling PHP Applications](http://derickrethans.nl/talks/profiling-ezc11.pdf) by Derik Rethans
* Varnish 3.0 release by Per Buer, CEO of Varnish (many thanks for the very nice T-Shirt !)


Unfortunately, I was not able to attend the hackathon due to an early flight but
I'm happy to see [many pull requests from
it](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-legacy/pulls). We have some merge to
do on Monday and that's pretty cool. Let's hope many more will come !
