OK that's completely useless, hence why you have to [generate
yours](http://jsstyle.github.com/#create) and spread the world with it! Now,
I want a compatibility checker ;-)

[The details can be viewed on the
website](http://jsstyle.github.com/?838078131129297429667031171770#text), here
are my JavaScript style key points:

* no processor, pure JavaScript only
* indent with spaces
* comma at the end in lists
* **ALWAYS** use semicolons
* private names begins with an underscore
* variable declaration at the beginning
