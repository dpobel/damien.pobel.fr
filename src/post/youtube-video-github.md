It's not really possible to properly embed a video in a Github comment, pull
request or issue like [it's possible for
images](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests/)
for instance. So if you want to put a video in a Github pull request (I do that
quite often), you have to upload it to a video hosting service like Youtube and
then you can put the link in the description. This is not what I would call
*embedding a video* but at least it's simple and effective.

Lately, I discovered [on Stackoverflow a much better
solution](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11804820/embed-a-you-tube-video)
where the simple text link to the video hosting service is replaced by a
thumbnail generated by the video platform. In markdown, for Youtube this gives:

```md
[![Alt text](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VID/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VID)
```

Of course, `VID` should be replaced by the actual Youtube video id. This is
still not *embedding a video* but that's a bit nicer and a much better incentive
to click to watch the video :-) The only problem is that it's a tad long to
type and to remember. That's why I decided to write a
[Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) script to
simplify that. Actually, at first I wanted to write a super simple
[bookmarklet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) but Firefox has [a very
annoying issue where bookmarklets are broken on Content Security Policy enabled
website](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=866522) like [on
Github](https://github.com/blog/1477-content-security-policy) :-(

Anyway, the Greasemonkey script is available [on Github in
`dpobel/github-add-youtube-video`](https://github.com/dpobel/github-add-youtube-video/).
To use it, you first need [to install
Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) and
then just load the
[`addvideo.user.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpobel/github-add-youtube-video/master/addvideo.user.js)
in your browser, it should ask if you want to install that script. After doing
that, [the Github markdown
editor](https://github.com/blog/2097-improved-commenting-with-markdown) should
get a shiny new button that is able to transform any Youtube URL to the previous code
snippet, here is the script in action:

<figure class="object-center bordered">
    <img src="/images/youtube-video-github.gif" alt="Screencast of github-add-youtube-video Greasemonkey script">
    <figcaption>
        Screencast of <a href="https://github.com/dpobel/github-add-youtube-video/blob/master/addvideo.user.js">github-add-youtube-video Greasemonkey script</a>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

If nothing is selected in the textarea, hitting button will just prompt the
user for a Youtube URL to embed. This script should also work in Greasemonkey clones
for Chrome, though I did not test it.
