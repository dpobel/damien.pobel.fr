Today, I have learned that my [eZ Publish](/tag/ez-publish) extension [Video FLV
Datatype](http://projects.ez.no/ezvideoflv) is now used in a real site:
[Zenaba](http://www.zenaba.com/). It's a french community and shopping site
dedicated to women. Video FLV Datatype is used to provide FLV conversion so that
user's videos can be viewed by anyone having the flash plugin installed.

In addition, thanks to my interview in the first issue of Share magazine
(ez.no/company/news/share_magazine_is_out_now, page put offline since), [Bruce
Morrison](http://suffandnonsense.blogspot.com/) has reported some problems. He
also proposed interesting ideas in [the project's
forum](http://projects.ez.no/ezvideoflv/forum/general). So, he's now [a member
of the team](http://projects.ez.no/ezvideoflv/team/members).
