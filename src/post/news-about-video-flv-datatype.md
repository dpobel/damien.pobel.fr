Today, I have learned that my [eZ Publish](/tag/ez+publish) extension [Video FLV Datatype](http://projects.ez.no/ezvideoflv) is now used in a real site : [Zenaba](http://www.zenaba.com/). It's a french community and shopping site dedicated to women. Video FLV Datatype is used to provide FLV conversion so that user's videos can be viewed by anyone having the flash plugin installed. I'm very happy to see [that even I don't need to braid my hair](http://www.zenaba.com/fr/communaute/videos/coiffure/tresses/comment_faire_des_tresses) :-)


In addition, thanks to my interview in [the first issue of Share magazine](http://ez.no/company/news/share_magazine_is_out_now), [Bruce Morrison](http://suffandnonsense.blogspot.com/) has reported some problems. He also proposed interesting ideas in [the project's forum.](http://projects.ez.no/ezvideoflv/forum/general) So, he's now [a member of the team](http://projects.ez.no/ezvideoflv/team/members).
