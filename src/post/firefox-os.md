[Firefox OS](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/partners/#os) begins to make
some noise these days and that's pretty cool! For those who don't know it yet,
Firefox OS is the last project from the Mozilla Foundation that aims at
building a mobile OS powered by
[Gecko](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko) (the layout
engine behind Firefox). As a result in Firefox OS, almost everything is built
with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

From a technical point of view, this is just a brilliant and exciting idea!
Those technologies are open and standardized. And [to start developping your own
applications](https://marketplace.firefox.com/developers/docs/quick_start), you
just need your preferred text editor and a recent version of Firefox!

I'm very happy with Android 4.2 on my Nexus 4 but I'd really like to start using
(and maybe hacking :-)) Firefox OS on a real device (instead of [the
simulator](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-os-simulator/)),
unfortunatelly, [the compatible
devices](https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/B2G/blob/master/config.sh#L51) and the
port efforts are [quite rare and unstable at the
moment](https://autonome.wordpress.com/2013/01/15/firefox-os-devices-and-dark-matter/).
While writing this post, I found that [Firefox OS can also be installed on Nexus
7](https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G/Nexus7) but the lack of WIFI explained in the
last sentence of this page is not very motivatingâ€¦
