Yesterday I've discovered [Real Favicon
Generator.net](http://realfavicongenerator.net), this is **a great tool** [to
check](http://realfavicongenerator.net/favicon_checker) and to generate the code
to handle the favicon(s) on a website. Of course, my first reflex was to run it
on my website and apparently I do it (partly) wrong. Before running this tool, I
thought the handling of the favicon(s) is a quite easy task but actually it
seems like it's really complicated and [it gets more and more complicated as new
devices/systems/browsers are
created/updated](http://realfavicongenerator.net/change_log). For now, if you
want to get a wide support you need to put something like the following snippet
on every pages:

```xml
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="57x57" href="/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png" />
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="114x114" href="/apple-touch-icon-114x114.png" />
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="72x72" href="/apple-touch-icon-72x72.png" />
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="144x144" href="/apple-touch-icon-144x144.png" />
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="60x60" href="/apple-touch-icon-60x60.png" />
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="120x120" href="/apple-touch-icon-120x120.png" />
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="76x76" href="/apple-touch-icon-76x76.png" />
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="152x152" href="/apple-touch-icon-152x152.png" />
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/favicon-196x196.png" sizes="196x196" />
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/favicon-160x160.png" sizes="160x160" />
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/favicon-96x96.png" sizes="96x96" />
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/favicon-32x32.png" sizes="32x32" />
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/favicon-16x16.png" sizes="16x16" />
<meta name="msapplication-TileColor" content="#2d89ef" />
<meta name="msapplication-TileImage" content="/mstile-144x144.png" />
```

Seriously 13 variations of the same favicon image to link in the HTML
document? Actually it's even worse, the zip file generated by the Real Favicon
Generator contains 22 files (an XML file and 21 variations of the
same image...), for something like 650 kb! WTF! And with the current way of
embedding the favicons, this will just keep on growing!

Apple, Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, maybe it's time to start cleaning up this
mess and to find a standard solution that *scales* over time, don't you think?

Edit: [Damien Alexandre shared on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/damienalexandre/status/408157056080687106) [this
nice summary with some possible
simplifications](https://github.com/audreyr/favicon-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.rst)
if you are not too *obsessive* on this topic.
