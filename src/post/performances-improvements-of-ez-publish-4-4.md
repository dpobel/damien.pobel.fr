As in almost every new release, [eZ Publish](/tag/ez-publish) is announced to perform better than the previous release This was true when [4.0 was released](/post/comparaison-de-performances-entre-ez-publish-4-0-1-et-4-1) and also for [the version 4.1](/post/comparaison-de-performances-entre-ez-publish-4-0-1-et-4-1). And what about the new 4.4 ?


[As I wrote earlier (in french)](/post/mise-a-jour-de-pwet-fr-et-planet-ezpublish-fr-vers-ez-publish-4-4), eZ Publish brings a new session system that only creates a session when it's needed. Now, it's also possible [to configure the way sessions are stored](http://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/4.x/Reference/Configuration-files/site.ini/Session/Handler), by default the file system is used instead of the database in the previous versions. In terms of performance, this new feature is promising and since my upgrades, I find the pages more responsive but it was only a feeling.


Today, I check the crawl graphs generated by [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools). The following chart shows the download time of pages by Googlebot. I think the change is quite clear (the green line represents the date of the upgrade) :

</a></figure>


The chart of Planet eZ Publish.fr is also interesting :

<figure class="object-center"><a href="/images/response-time-of-planet-ezpublish-fr-by-google-webmaster-tools.png">![Response time of planet-ezpublish.fr by Google Webmaster Tools](/images//response-time-of-planet-ezpublish-fr-by-google-webmaster-tools.png)
</a></figure>


it's interesting because just after the upgrade, I discovered an issue with the static cache on this site so I disabled it and as we can see, the difference between the static cache setup and the classical setup is not that big on this site !


Obviously, those results are only valid on my sites.&nbsp;One thing to mention is that Googlebot doesn't support session, so before eZ Publish 4.4 each time the robot requested a page, a new session was created and thus a new entry in the <code>ezsession</code>
 table was added. For normal user, this behaviour is only true the first time he visits the site. then the new session system only avoids one SQL SELECT query.
