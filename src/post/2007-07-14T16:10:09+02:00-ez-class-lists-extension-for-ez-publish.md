[eZ Class Lists](http://projects.ez.no/ezclasslists) adds a tab to the Administration Interface of [eZ Publish](/tag/ez+publish) that lists objects sorted by modification date. It is possible to restrict the list to a given content class.


It is a small and very simple extension. I wrote it because I receive a lots of spam trackbacks on [my blog](/) and this extension lets me quickly delete trackback objects.
