[eZ Publish 4.0.1 has been released this
week](http://ez.no/developer/news/ez_publish_4_0_1_3_10_1_and_3_9_5_released), I
upgraded this afternoon because of [security advisories on eZ Publish
4.0](http://share.ez.no/community-project/security-advisories). In fact, there's
nothing to say, [the upgrade runs
smoothly](http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/upgrading/upgrading_to_4_0/from_4_0_x_to_4_0_y)
without any major problem for me, even [on migrating more than 60 000 URL
aliases](/post/upgrading-a-large-site-from-ez-publish-3-9-2-to-ez-publish-3-10)
on [a small server](/post/ez-publish-sur-dedibox). Great job eZ guys!
