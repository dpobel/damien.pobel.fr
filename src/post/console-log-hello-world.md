Hello world! And welcome on my brand new blog. And when I write *new*, I mean
**NEW**.

First, the URL is now http://damien.pobel.fr/, nothing fancy here, that's my
name, and maybe, thanks to that change (and some others...), this website will
be the first result in Google when searching for "[Damien
Pobel](https://www.google.com/search?q=damien+pobel)"!

Second, as you can see if you're not reading this text through an aggregator, there
are a lot of visible changes, I hope you like it as much I'm proud of it ;-) I
also removed the comments, I don't know yet if it's definitive or not.

Lastly, it's not based on [eZ Publish](/tag/ez+publish) anymore. It's built with a
tool called [Lectroid](https://github.com/rgrove/lectroid) which is a *really
boring blog engine* written in JavaScript by [Ryan Grove](http://wonko.com/). I
discovered this tool while randomly browsing repositories on Github and I found
it very closed to what I had in mind for a potential new blog for months now.
It's also a good occasion to dive a bit more into the server side JavaScript. I will
probably explain more in details in an other post why Lectroid is far less boring
than what its tagline suggests. But in any case, I want to thank Ryan for publishing
it on Github.

For the people interested in eZ Publish, don't worry, I will still write blog
posts on this fantastic <abbr title="Content Management
System">CMS</abbr>. The 5.x story has just began, the next months will be
interesting :-)
