[eZ Class Lists 0.2](http://projects.ez.no/ezclasslists) for [eZ Publish](/tag/ez-publish) is out. [eZ Class Lists is very small et simple extension](/post/ez-class-lists-extension-for-ez-publish) released under the term of the GPL that adds a tab in the administration interface where you can list objects by content class without the tree structure. It is also possible to delete or edit objects from this tab.


## Change Log :

* [Bugfixes in templates](http://ez.no/developer/contribs/applications/ez_class_lists#msg150671) (Thanks to Daniele Nocentini)
* Bugfixes in translation
* Javascript confirmation (can be disable in settings)
* Move to trash checkbox (default value can be set in settings)

I also marked it as *stable* on [projects.ez.no](http://projects.ez.no/) and in the [Contribs section of eZ.no](http://ez.no/developer/contribs) as it is very simple and I have used it since 4 months without problem. ( *Note: I hope that projects.ez.no and contribs will be joined together soon, projects.ez.no is great, it only lacks a simple bug tracker and more visibility...*)
