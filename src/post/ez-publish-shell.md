[A screencast](http://vrac.pwet.fr/ez_publish_shell.gif) is better than several
words. It's not (yet ?) really useful as you can only browse and read content,
but it was fun to write. Nevertheless, I can imagine a real and serious use of
an [eZ Publish](/tag/ez-publish) shell for example to write simple scripts
without the need to learn the [eZ Publish
API](http://pubsvn.ez.no/doxygen/trunk/LS/html/index.html) in details or to provide
a quick interface to developers. [The source code is
available](/files/ezshell-0.01.tar.gz) if someone is interested...
