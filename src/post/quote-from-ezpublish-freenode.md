About [my URL Aliases problem](/post/url-aliases-transformed-into-numbers-when-upgrading-to-ez-publish-3-10-0), on [#ezpublish@freenode](http://ezpedia.org/wiki/en/ez/irc), November 25, 2007 :

```

21:49 <tigrou> URL Alias are transformed into numbers :(
21:51 <tigrou> don't understand where is the problem
22:39 <tigrou> ah i am stupid
22:48 <_buz> ez has its way of making you feel like that
22:48 <_buz> in fact, whomever called it ez had a very strange kind of humour
```


A little bit hard for [eZ Publish](/tag/ez-publish), but it's just funny :-)
