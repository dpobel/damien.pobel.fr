# About...

## the author

I'm a software engineer interested in the web and open technologies. If you want
to learn more about my professional skills and background, please have a look on
[my curriculum vitæ](/page/cv) (or [its french version](/page/cv-fr)).

In the real life, I like sports ([mountain bike](http://vtt.revermont.bike/),
table tennis, ...), I try to take [photos](/tag/photo) and I'm also the happy
dad of two cute little girls called Charline and Clémentine. I live in a small
french village called [St Paul de Varax](http://mairie-saintpauldevarax.fr/).

of the different topics by looking at [the good old tag cloud](/tags).
