# About...

## the author

I'm a software engineer interested in the web and open technologies. If you want
to learn more about my professional skills and background, please have a look on
[my curriculum vit√¶](/page/cv) (or [its french version](/page/cv-fr)).

In the real life, I like sports ([mountain bike](http://vtt.revermont.bike/), table tennis, ...), I try to
take [photos](/tag/photo) and I'm also the happy dad of a cute little girl called
Charline. I live in a small french village called [St Paul de
Varax](http://mairie-saintpauldevarax.fr/).

I write things online [since 2006](/post/ouverture) on a lots of different
topics, sometimes in French, sometimes in English. You can have a quick overview
of the different topics by looking at [the good old tag cloud](/tags).

## this website

This website is built with [a modified
version](https://github.com/dpobel/lectroid/tree/damien_pobel_fr) of
[Lectroid](https://github.com/rgrove/lectroid), *a really boring blog engine*
written by [Ryan Grove](http://www.wonko.com). If you are interested in
Lectroid, *[Powered by Lectroid, JavaScript and
Node.js](http://damien.pobel.fr/post/powered-lectroid-javascript-nodejs)*
shortly explains why I choose this tool and some of the changes I did on it.
