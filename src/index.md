## Welcome!

I'm Damien Pobel and welcome to *my personal homepage*. Yeah, I know this sounds
very like the 90s, but this page is really *my* space mostly with [my
blog](/posts/) and [my résumé](/page/cv/).

I'm also spread all over the Internets under variations of the  nicknames
`dpobel` and `tigrou` (that's a long and uninteresting story...):

* [@dpobel](https://twitter.com/dpobel) for a lots of things, like ranting,
  rambling, grumbling, moaning and sometimes sharing interesting things
* [dpobel on Github](https://github.com/dpobel/) because that's a professional
  tool and because I'm a geek (maybe not in this order)
* [tigrou on 500px](https://500px.com/tigrou) trying to take *Photos*
  but at the moment I'm unsure of the success in that quest
* [TiGr0u on Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/TiGr0u) for Rock'n Roll!
* [dpobel on instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dpobel/) well because it's fun
  ;-)
* [dpobel on Linkedin](http://fr.linkedin.com/in/dpobel) to receive news from
  people I've never met, I don't know or I don't remember ;-)
* [+DamienPobel](https://plus.google.com/+DamienPobel) to... I don't really
  know these days
* and a few others...
